# odin-rock-paper-scissors

Hey, this was a very fun project due to UI implementation.
Since I already have some experience in python, c and cpp, coding rock, paper and scissor was a cake walk and kinda boring, but implementation of UI was very fun and rewarding.
Looking forward to the journey with The Odin Project 😁
